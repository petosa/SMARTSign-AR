# SMARTSign Magic
A cross-platform phone application for learning sign language on the fly. Part of The Center for Accessible Technology in Sign (CATS) at Georgia Tech. http://www.cats.gatech.edu/

Works on Android, iOS, and Windows phones.

# Description
Use the built in camera to snap photos of text you come across at school, at the library, or anywhere. SignBook extracts text from the photo and presents you with videos demonstrating how to sign those words in American Sign Language. Videos courtesy of CATS.

# How it Works
The app itself was built with the cross-platform ionic framework. OCR (text extraction from images) is done using Google's new Vision API: https://cloud.google.com/vision/

You can save pictures you take to your SignBook so you can review them whenever.
