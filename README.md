# SignBook
A cross-platform phone application for learning sign language on the fly. Part of The Center for Accessible Technology in Sign (CATS) at Georgia Tech. http://www.cats.gatech.edu/

Works on Android, iOS, and Windows phones.

# How it Works
Use the built in camera to snap photos of text you come across at school, while reading, or while shopping. SignBook extracts text from the picture and presents you with videos demonstrating how to sign those words in ASL. Videos courtesy of CATS.
